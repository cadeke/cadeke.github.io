## Description
This project was made by three students for a university course where we learned how to build a start-up from an initial idea. We were tasked with creating a product that would solve a major problem that is currently present in our society. We choose to create a game that would engage high school students in different ways as opposed to traditional teaching methods.

## Overview
This project was built using the Unity game engine and contained assets from the Unity Asset Store. We created a virtual world where students can play together and solve different kind of challenges. 

The point of the game is to help children learn math through a gamified environment. The player has to discovered the world and the minigames in it, where they will be faced with questions that can be inserted by a teacher or parent via a separate website. This way, children who are interested in games and their mechanics can enjoy them while also practicing their homework!

We also built a proof-of-concept of a management interface, where a teacher could prepare a list of questions, which would then be loaded into the game and used as challenges for the players. Because this project is only a prototype, we did not fully integrate all the functionality we initially had in mind.

## Result

After some months of work, we were very happy with our resulting product, which we present to the rest of our class and a panel of teachers. We got very positive feedback and were even thinking of continuing this project as an actual start-up, but ended up not doing that.

Nevertheless, we were very proud of what we had accomplished. You can find the full walktrough of the game on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGwX1Vd6C3M&ab_channel=CasperDeKeyser). The following screenshots show off some of the game world and functionality.

## Credits
I would like to thank my fellow team members Olivier Du Four and Ruben Simons for their hard work and dedication to this project. We were able to create a lot of features with a relatively small team, while balancing other projects as well.
