Hello there! I'm Casper and welcome to my personal website. Here you can discover some information about me. 

I recently graduated from my master's degree in Cyber Security at the FHSTP in Austria. I'm also trying to stay up-to-date with events happening in the technology / software security / hacking space and do some small projects to improve my skills in areas of interest. 

Feel free to reach out using the contact options listed below.
