Hello there! I'm Casper and welcome to my personal website. Here you can discover some information about me. 

I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Cyber Security at the FHSTP in Austria. In the meantime, I try to stay up to date with events happening in the cyber security / software security / hacking space and do some small projects to improve my skills in areas of interest. 

Feel free to reach out using the contact options listed below.
