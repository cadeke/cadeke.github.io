In my case, the last semester of my degree was dedicated to the thesis, presenting us with topics from all areas of information technology security.</p> <h4 id="situating-the-topic">Situating the topic</h4> <p>My topic is related to the domain of infrastructure and networking, more specifically focussing on on-premises container orchestration platforms. This is a relevant area of research since it is closely related to cloud computing deployments, which has been a prominent movement in the last years. Whether you leverage the cloud in a private, public or hybrid context, it is crucial to architect your workloads efficiently in order to reap the most benefits for the lowest cost.</p> <h4 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h4> <p>My thesis aimed at finding suitable alternatives for Kubernetes for orchestration containerized workloads in a self-hosted production-grade environment. Kubernetes’ popularity is undeniable, but so is the complexity associated with it, having a notoriously high learning curve. I wanted to research if other technologies could pose as a better solution for a use-case that specifically targets SME teams in charge of managing their own deployments. Through the practical evaluation of different orchestration candidates, I attempted to deliver insights in the technology landscape and in the domain of container orchestration in general.</p> <h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2> <h4 id="literature-review">Literature review</h4> <p>During the review of the state of the art, I analyzed different publications in the domains of Kubernetes complexity, managed Kubernetes cloud services and comparisons between different orchestration technologies. This gave me insights that I could use to design my use-case and select relevant technologies as testing candidates during the practical implementation.</p> <h4 id="design-of-use-case">Design of use-case</h4> <p>I motivated the use-case with various technical and non-technical requirements. The application itself, which was called “ARGO”, was designed as a microservice architecture in order to be a suitable candidate for a containerized deployment. The functionality was inspired by DNS, with some simplifications in terms of functionality and data model. The following image shows the high-level architecture of the “ARGO” application, with each purple rectangle representing a service consisting out of one or more containers.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/argo/argo-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/argo/argo-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/argo/argo-2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/argo/argo-2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="argo architecture" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> High-level overview of ARGO microservice architecture </div> <h4 id="selection-of-technologies">Selection of technologies</h4> <p>With the insights gained from the literature review, I made a selection of orchestration features which were relevant for my use-case. These features formed the baseline criteria in order to make a selection of orchestration candidates. Some technologies that were considered include Red Hat OpenShift, k3s, k0s, Apache Mesos, HashiCorp Nomad and Docker Swarm. After further review, Nomad and Swarm were selected as candidates for the practical implementation, because of their relevance to the use-case and the amount and type of research done on these technologies.</p> <h4 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation criteria</h4> <p>Prior to implementation the “ARGO” application, I revisited the criteria which I wanted to investigate, in order to have a structure review process. Criteria I wanted to analyze include the scheduling of containers, scaling capabilities, service discovery, fault tolerance during container or node failure, HA during application updates, network segmentation, shared storage between nodes, load balancing, encrypted internal communications and centralized secret management.</p> <p>Additionally, I introduced a simple grading schema in order to quantify the findings in the final stages of the thesis. This formula included two factors, one for the documentation support and one for the implementation experience, with an additional weighing factor. This allowed me to give a final grade for each tested candidate.</p> <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2> <h4 id="testing-environment">Testing environment</h4> <p>The infrastructure used for the practical part of the thesis was provided by the university, in the form of eight VMs. Through the use of snapshots and IaC, I managed the configurations for both Swarm and Nomad, in such a way I could roll back to a stable state whenever necessary.</p> <h4 id="base-implementation">Base implementation</h4> <p>As a first step of the practical implementation, I developed the system and ran it locally using Docker Compose. This served as the base implementation from which I could make the necessary adjustments for the following orchestration candidates. The following snippet shows the entire stack running locally with Docker Compose.</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> docker compose up <span class="nt">-d</span>

The documentation was clear and included useable examples in order to get up and running quickly. A big advantage was that all necessary software components were already included by default into the Docker Engine, so there was no need for additional installation or configuration. Just some small steps to establish the cluster was all that was needed in order to start deployments.</p> <p>As an example, the following snippet shows the entire stack running on Swarm, with some components being scaled to multiple instances, and others publishing their ports in Swarm’s routing mesh.</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>student@vm01:~/stacks&gt; docker service <span class="nb">ls

</code></pre></div></div> <div class="caption"> Overview of application update to a service running in Nomad </div> <h2 id="results">Results</h2> <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4> <p>As a conclusion, I found that Swarm aligned more closely with the use-case’s requirements, especially since it was quite straight forward to get up and running. Nomad felt more suited for medium to large deployments, allowing for more customization at the cost of an increased complexity.</p> <h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4> <p>The insights gained from this research can be used in various ways. Technical leads can evaluate their orchestration needs and pick one of the solution I have covered as a starting point. They can also use certain parts of my use-case, or some of my experiences, for their own applications. Since I opted for a microservice architecture, all components are modular and can be swapped if this is required (e.g. for a standardized technology choice or similar reasons). Finally, organization can use the findings to better understand container orchestration in general, and prepare their developers and application in a more appropriate way, which would have a larger chance of success.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ul> <li>GitHub repo with all relevant documents, code and artifacts can be found <a href="https://github.com/cadeke/argo">here</a></li> <li>Full thesis can be found <a href="https://github.com/cadeke/argo/blob/main/docs/thesis.pdf">here</a></li> <li>Short paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/cadeke/argo/blob/main/docs/paper.pdf">here</a></li> </ul> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> &copy; Copyright 2025 Casper De Keyser.
